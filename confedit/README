This is a web based file editor written in perl. 
It is extremely basic. It performs no validation whatsoever. 
It WILL let you overwrite files without warning. It will NOT preserve your edits if 
your save fails. USE ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK! 

This file is self contained. Copy the confedit.pl file to your /usr/lib/cgi-bin/ directory, 
then you can open it at http://<MINER-IP>/confedit.pl

For this to save files, you will need to execute 'visudo' and add the following lines 
to the end of the file:
Defaults targetpw
www-data ALL=(ALL) /bin/cp

This allows the web server to execute the 'cp' command with a given users name and password 
(and thus save the file).
