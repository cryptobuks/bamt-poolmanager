This is a web based file editor written in perl. 
It is extremely basic. It performs no validation whatsoever. 
It WILL let you overwrite files without warning. It may cause cancer. 
USE ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK! 

This file is self contained. Copy the confedit.pl file to your /usr/lib/cgi-bin/ directory, 
then you can open it at http://<MINER-IP>/confedit.pl

For any file to be saved by this tool, it has to be writable by the web server 
(generally insecure and ill-advised); e.g. 'chmod +w /path/to/file'. 

Good luck!
