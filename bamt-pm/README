This is Island Farm and Mining Implement BAMT-PoolManager, 
an extension of the default BAMT web interface that allows you to manage cgminer pools, 
has a few system stats, config editor, and stop/start miner control. 
It was written and tested on litecoin-bamt 1.2 
( https://litecointalk.org/index.php?topic=2924.0 ), but should work on any BAMT based 
distro (SMOS, etc). I am interested to hear if it doesnt. I am on freenode in #scrypt-mining 

INSTALL: 
Executing the install-pm.sh script as root ('sudo ./install-pm.sh') will put the files in 
the right places, and enable some Apache security.  

If you run the install-pm.sh in bamt-pm/ you can ignore the other directories. 

Please make sure the following entries are in your cgminer.conf 
(usually /etc/bamt/cgminer.conf):
"api-listen" : true,
"api-port" : "4028",
"api-allow" : "W:127.0.0.1",

NOTES:
Pool priority is not preserved by CGminer when it stops. CGminer will prioritize the pools 
in the conf when it starts in the same order that they appear, so if you have a pool you 
always want to be Pri 0 on start, make it Pool 0.
