This is BAMT-PoolManager, a extension of the default BAMT web interface 
that allows you to manage pools, has a few system stats, and stop/start miner control. 

Executing the install.sh script will put the files in the right places. 

To allow the web interface permission to stop/start the miner, you will need to add the 
following line in /etc/sudoers: 

www-data localhost=(ALL)NOPASSWD:/usr/sbin/mine

Please use 'visudo' to edit sudoers.
