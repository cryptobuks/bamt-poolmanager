This is Island Farm and Mining Implement BAMT-PoolManager, 
an extension of the default BAMT web interface that allows you to manage pools, 
has a few system stats, and stop/start miner control. 
It was written and tested on litecoin-bamt 1.2 
( https://litecointalk.org/index.php?topic=2924.0 ), but should work on any BAMT based 
distro (SMOS, etc). I am interested to hear if it doesnt. 

Executing the install.sh script as root will put the files in the right places. 

Please make sure the following entries are in your cgminer.conf 
(usually /etc/bamt/cgminer.conf):
"api-listen" : true,
"api-port" : "4028",
"api-allow" : "W:127.0.0.1",

To allow the web interface permission to stop/start the miner, you will need to add the 
following line in /etc/sudoers: 
www-data ALL=(ALL)NOPASSWD:/usr/sbin/mine

Please use 'visudo' to edit sudoers.
