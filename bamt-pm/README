This is Island Farm and Mining Implement BAMT-PoolManager, 
an extension of the default BAMT web interface that allows you to manage cgminer pools, 
has a few system stats, and stop/start miner control. 
It was written and tested on litecoin-bamt 1.2 
( https://litecointalk.org/index.php?topic=2924.0 ), but should work on any BAMT based 
distro (SMOS, etc). I am interested to hear if it doesnt. 
I am on freenode in #scrypt-mining 

Executing the install.sh script as root ('sudo ./install.sh') will put the files in 
the right places. 

Please make sure the following entries are in your cgminer.conf 
(usually /etc/bamt/cgminer.conf):
"api-listen" : true,
"api-port" : "4028",
"api-allow" : "W:127.0.0.1",

To allow the web interface permission to stop/start the miner, you will need to run 
'visudo' and add the following line:
www-data ALL=(ALL)NOPASSWD:/usr/sbin/mine
